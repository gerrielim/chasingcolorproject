Vishwadha is the current Miss UAB.
“I was born in India and moved to the states when I was one. More specifically, I'm from South India.


A majority of my support system has come from the Indian family and community I grew up in. The people around me always encouraged me to continue learning Indian dance which truly helped me learn about my roots and where I come from. People appreciated the fact that I could speak my mother tongue (huge thanks to my parents for making me speak Telugu at home always). Also, AT LEAST one meal each day at home had to be Indian, so I never missed out on that either. All of these small things combined made a huge impact on my Indian American identity. While my Indian culture comprises a 100% of my identity, the other 100% of my identity--yes, I said the other 100%--is American. In other words, both my Indian and American culture are equally important to me. I don't value one over the other because they constitute me wholly.

I visit India often and know my culture and religion. I watch Indian movies and sing along to Bollywood and Tollywood songs. I eat (and sometimes cook) Indian food, and the list goes on. However, I ALSO lived in America my entire life. The majority of my friends are Caucasian, Chinese, Mexican, Indian, and any other ethnicity you can think of. I watch American movies. I sing to rap, pop, and country music. I immerse myself in the American lifestyle like everyone else.

All of these experiences have truly allowed me to become a more open-minded and empathetic person. The struggles people face to ‘fit in’ usually hits home for me, but I've been able to grow out of that as I began to embrace my Indian culture and heritage. Now, that representation is something that I stand for each and every day in everything I do, and I also encourage those around me to do the same to represent who they are. I'm so beyond thankful that I grew up learning about where I came from because introspection of your own identity broadens your possibilities of what you think you can and can't do. I've found that I am a thousand times more successful in all that I do when I am genuine with myself.

When asked about how her identity affects the way she navigates the world, Vishwadha said, “It's hard to explain, but I am constantly in a battle between my American and Indian mindset when it comes to making decisions.

When I identify myself as an Indian American female, it means that I have a strong desire to fulfill the duties of what it means to be both Indian and American to me. Some of the Indian things that constitutes is being able to go to the temple and pray to my God, continuing my Indian classical dance education (which also teaches me a lot about Indian mythology which I can share with the rest of the world!), staying up to date on the latest movies, music, and gossip in India (you know to the best of my ability...especially when amazing and inspiring people like Priyanka Chopra, Nina Davuluri, Deepica Mutyala, and Rupi Kaur are breaking all kinds of barriers in America today!!) Some of the American things that constitutes is actually choosing my own career path with full support from my parents, participating in scholarship pageants, embracing my independence and freedom as a young female, and fulfilling my love for travel and exploration.”

Vishwadha’s earliest memory of being othered is “elementary school. I was always reminded that I was different, but not because of my race, or skin color, or anything...more because of the food I brought for lunch. It sounds pretty silly, but it's just the truth. Every time I brought some sort of Indian food, I would get weird looks and sometimes even rude comments from classmates, and then, before you even know it, no one wants to sit next to you in the reading circle after lunch. These kinds of experiences at such young ages can be extremely confusing for a 5 year old and make you think that you are different from others. This is especially true when that 5 year old doesn't have the capacity to realize that ‘different’ can still be a good thing and should not affect the way you view yourself.

I still have moments when I feel unsure about myself, and I may think about acting a certain way to avoid being ‘othered.’ But those are the moments when I remind myself that if I stand up for who I am, I can bring awareness to our differences and the beauty found in our differences. That will just make it a little more easier for future Indian Americans and those of other ethnicities.

Domestic Violence Awareness and Prevention is a cause that I'm particularly passionate about. I did not know much about this social issue until I joined my sorority Sigma Sigma Rho Sorority Inc. It was astonishing for me to find out that so many people that were my age, and even younger than me, become victims of domestic violence. It's also an extremely prevalent issue in India where it's even more difficult for women and men to escape from because of the stigma associated with it. ANYONE could be a victim. I'm so glad I can work with an empowering group of young women through my sorority for a philanthropy that is so prevalent worldwide by raising awareness and prevention methods for domestic violence, educating people on the signs that show domestic violence, bringing in victims to share their stories on campus and in the community, raising money for shelters, etc.

1. Be yourself unapologetically.
You have to be who you WANT to be regardless of how you think people
will perceive you. As long as you're being true to yourself, you're being
true to this world, and that's all that matters.
(My favorite quote is actually "To be yourself in a world that is
constantly trying to make you someone else is the greatest
accomplishment.")
2. Take the people around you with you on your journey.
You'll want them with you through the good AND the bad. I know I would
not be where I am today without the people who have supported me all
my life.
3. Have big dreams and chase them.
It doesn't matter if no one has ever done whatever it is you want to do, or
if it's too ‘unrealistic.’

Simply put, for me, living the American dream represents the capacity to fulfill any dreams and life goals while experiencing life authentically. It also means to grow while uplifting and learning from all the different people around you.

In the future, I hope to work in my own dental clinic and teach Indian classical dance (maybe Bollywood and other styles??) on the side. If it's meant to be, I hope to hold the title of Miss Alabama and also officially start a non-profit organization with my platform #StrengtheningCulturalConsciousness one day. That being said, I won't be surprised if my goals change in the next few years, and I'm excited to see where life takes me.
